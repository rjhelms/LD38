bacteria in a petri dish
territory expansion
flocking algorithm

player controls a single bacteria

bacteria
	have "tribes"
		ie friends and enemies
		
	simple state machine:
		flock
			default behaviour
			implement a boids algorithm
			if health < threshhold, eat
			if energy < threshhold, sleep
		eat
			seek out a food source of some sort
			if health > threshhold, flock
		sleep
			just idle, except for avoiding other tribes
			if energy > threshhold, flock
			if health < threshhold, eat
	
	implicit heirarchy of needs in state machine:
		food
		sleep
		social
		
	so attributes:
		health
			ticks down whenever they move
			absorb health of whatever they eat
		energy
			ticks down whenever they move
			ticks up when they move
